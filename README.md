# BP-To-Text
A lightweight, browser-based tool that converts messy Unreal Engine Blueprint "Copy-Paste" text (T3D) into clean, human-readable pseudocode. It recursively resolves data connections and follows execution flows (including Branches) to turn complex spaghetti nodes into a structured logic tree ready for AI or docs.
